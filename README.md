# HTTP-Load-Balancer
this is from **Set Up Network and HTTP Load Balancers** GSP007 lab in Quicklabs
## Senario Presentation:
For this load balancing scenario, create three Compute Engine VM instances and install Apache on them,
then add a firewall rule that allows HTTP traffic to reach the instances.

## What is a Load Balancer in Google CloudPlatform?
External HTTP(S) Load Balancing is a proxy-based Layer 7 load balancer that enables you to run and scale your services behind a single external IP address. 
External HTTP(S) Load Balancing distributes HTTP and HTTPS traffic to backends hosted on a variety of Google Cloud platforms (such as Compute Engine, 
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Storage, and so on), as well as external backends connected over the internet or via hybrid connectivity
